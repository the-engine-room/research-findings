                <div class="hidden text" id="pi2">
                  <p>Researchers found that organisations they interviewed in Kenya “lacked the technical capacity to fully understand or anticipate issues associated with a given technology” - in <strong>59% of the projects assessed, participants said that a lack of technical knowledge was a barrier</strong>. <a href="http://www.makingallvoicescount.org/publication/digital-development-differently-lessons-adaptive-management-technology-governance-initiatives-kenya/" class="research-link" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Read the research.</a></p>
                  <p>In a review of MAVC-funded projects in Kenya, several “admitted that they may have been over-reliant on the advice of the tech experts they had engaged” and held them responsible for designing tech solutions that did not fit their context. <a href="http://www.makingallvoicescount.org/publication/tech-governance-programmes-kenya/" class="research-link" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Read the research</a> </p>.
                  <p>Of the seven organisations working on mHealth in Indonesia, Nigeria, South Africa and Tanzania that spoke to researchers, three <strong>felt ill-equipped to coordinate with tech providers and telecommunications companies</strong>. <a href="https://opendocs.ids.ac.uk/opendocs/bitstream/item/14034/RReport_ICTfacilitated_Online_final.pdf" class="research-link" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Read the research</a> </p>
                  <p>Only 3 of the 38 Kenyan and South African projects interviewed in 2015 did research in all three areas relevant to tech project design: the accountability problem, the technology options and the people who would use it. “<strong>Organisations were not able to identify or fill in their knowledge gaps</strong>, instead focusing on areas where they already had strong knowledge.” <a href="https://alidade.tech/page/research" class="research-link" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Read the research</a></p>

                <div class="hidden text" id="osw2">
                  <p class="hilite">Evidence from MAVC’s research projects suggests that <strong>it’s hard for organisations to find technical support from providers that understand their needs</strong>. However, when they do, it can make a big difference.</p>
                  <p>For example, the Ghana Center for Democratic Development and the technical provider VOTO Mobile <strong>took “far longer than anticipated” to design an interactive voice response (IVR) survey, going through eight iterations, but found that more people - particularly women - completed it</strong> as a result. <a href="http://www.makingallvoicescount.org/publication/crowdsourcing-citizen-feedback-district-development-ghana-using-interactive-voice-response-surveys/" class="research-link" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Read the research.</a></p>
                  <p>Another group in South Africa with a community organising background, “struggled to find appropriate technologies for a project monitoring public service delivery. They had <strong>much more success when they found a technology partner that they felt shared their values...</strong> to guide their understanding.” <a href="https://alidade.tech/page/research" class="research-link" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Read the research.</a></p>
                  <p>This suggests a need for organisations to understand and connect better with technical providers. For example, South African organisation the Foundation for Professional Development found that <strong>“there’s a need for a translator” between programme and technical staff</strong>. <a href="http://www.makingallvoicescount.org/publication/giving-voice-clients-post-rape-services-building-piloting-feedback-mechanism-tshwane/" class="research-link" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Read the research.</a></p>
                  <p>MAVC’s experiences suggest that <strong>active communities of practice are one way of helping organisations build this understanding.</strong> <a href="http://www.makingallvoicescount.org/publication/know-know-know-dont/" class="research-link" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Read the research</a></p>

                  <p>Only <strong>15 of the 38 transparency and accountability initiatives in Kenya and South Africa that researchers interviewed in 2015 did any user research</strong> before choosing a tech tool. <a href="https://alidade.tech/page/research" class="research-link" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Read the research.</a></p>
                  <p>Separately, a review of MAVC grantees in Kenya found that “many grantees conceived tech solutions that did not take the constraints of the targeted environment into account” citing problems such as “a service problem notification platform [that] only worked on laptops, which very few people had.” <a href="http://www.makingallvoicescount.org/publication/tech-governance-programmes-kenya/" class="research-link" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Read the research</a> </p>.
                  <p>Researchers looking at 24 organisations in Kenya in 2016 found that <strong>“most projects were poorly grounded in their contexts.”</strong> <a href="http://www.makingallvoicescount.org/publication/digital-development-differently-lessons-adaptive-management-technology-governance-initiatives-kenya/" class="research-link" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> Read the research</a></p>

                  <p class="hilite"><strong>When organisations do user research, they usually find out essential information.</strong></p>
                  <p>Looking back, 79% of the Kenyan organisations interviewed in 2016 said that <strong>“adapting to context mattered a lot for the project.”</strong> <a href="http://www.makingallvoicescount.org/publication/digital-development-differently-lessons-adaptive-management-technology-governance-initiatives-kenya/" class="research-link" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Read the research</a></p>
                  <p>For example, the South African organisation Yowzit <strong>found that its users would only find the citizen participation platform convenient if they spoke English, were digitally literate and already used similar ratings platforms.</strong> This allowed them to retarget their work more effectively. <a href="http://www.makingallvoicescount.org/publication/lessons-yowzits-pracitioner-research-learning-process/" class="research-link" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Read the research.</a></p>
                  <p>Meanwhile, those of the 38 Kenyan and South African <strong>organisations that did user research and trialled tech tools with their intended users were much more likely to be happy with their choice.</strong> <a href="https://alidade.tech/page/research" class="research-link" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Read the research.</a></p>
                  <p>In these cases, the <strong>user research typically took longer, but could actually save money and time overall</strong>. In South Africa, the Foundation for Professional Development (FPD)’s user research showed them that they needed to focus on an app focused on clients’ needs, rather than the more ambitious programme they had planned. <a href="http://www.makingallvoicescount.org/publication/giving-voice-clients-post-rape-services-building-piloting-feedback-mechanism-tshwane/" class="research-link" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Read the research.</a></p>

                  <p>In Kenya, researchers found that many projects “reported that <strong>key stakeholders and important issues were not discovered until late in the implementation of the project</strong>, often in its last phases.” <a href="http://www.makingallvoicescount.org/publication/digital-development-differently-lessons-adaptive-management-technology-governance-initiatives-kenya/" class="research-link" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Read the research.</a></p>
